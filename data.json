Whether you are standing on the main deck of USS <i>Cassin Young</i> or are exploring the ship on a device from afar, you are about to see and hear the stories of men and women who built, repaired, served, and even sacrificed their lives on the steel decks of this storied ship.</p><p>This app shares these stories through oral histories that were recorded by park staff beginning in 1979. Accompanied by both private and public photographic collections of the ship, the stories are organized under different threads listed below. Feel free to explore and chose a thread and stop as you wish. You may follow in progression, or simply pick and choose from the map inside each thread where to go.</p><p>Because this is a largely unmodified vessel from World War II, self-guided tours with this app are limited to the main deck of the ship. Please be careful as you move about the ship and watch your step. If available, ranger-led tours of the ship offer access to many living and work spaces above and below the main deck.</p><p>We hope you enjoy your experience at the Charlestown Navy Yard aboard USS <i>Cassin Young</i>!</p>",

					introText : "Following the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, the United States officially entered the Second World War. The entire nation rapidly mobilized to fight. However, long before servicemen could be stationed aboard a warship such as USS <i>Cassin Young</i>, an army of draftsmen, engineers, ship fitters, welders, craftsmen, electricians, and painters&mdash;to name just a few of the job descriptions&mdash;were all required to build a single ship.</p><p>Here in the Charlestown Navy Yard, employment peaked at over 50,000 men and women to fulfill such a mission. Entering the gates of the Yard, they brought skill, determination, and ingenuity. By the time World War II came to a close, the workers who came to this Navy Yard had accomplished an astounding feat. In just a matter of a few years, the yard workers designed, built, outfitted, and repaired over 36 Destroyers (DDs), 62 Destroyer Escorts (DEs), and and 44 Tank Landing Ships (LSTs).</p>",

The deep granite dry docks, the tall steel portal cranes, the solid masonry workshops, and the long paved piers all form a maritime landscape that operated for 174 years. Nevertheless, some the most visible and enduring markers of the Charlestown Navy Yard&apos;s accomplishments date from the mid-twentieth century, during the most defining events of the century: The Second World War (1941-1945), and the Cold War (approximately 1949-1991)</p><p>During World War II, the yard operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Three shifts rotated constantly, day and night, rain, snow, or sunshine. Machine shops and forges stamped and pounded all the materiel that future and existing warships required. Though welders and riveters became the iconic image of the wartime yard worker, it was the planning, machining, and forging in the background that kept those welders and riveters going.</p>",

Propulsion systems and machinery had to be installed; put in place by the high portal cranes ashore and mounted solidly to the ship&apos;s structure. Cables, pipes, and ducts had to be run everywhere to specifications stated on blueprints.</p><p>Deep down inside these ships, adverse conditions pushed the limits of endurance and even health of the workers.

					introText : "<p>Upon leaving an American port, the crew of a ship left behind the comforts of private home life. While aircraft carriers were considered floating cities with many amenities and comforts, destroyers were more like small frontier towns. During World War II, as many as 325 officers and men called <i>Cassin Young</i> their home for as long as 18 months. By the 1950s that number dropped to as low as 250 officers and men. Nonetheless, extended cruises to far-flung places meant the crew had to eat, sleep, work, and weather calm seas or rough storms on a ship just 376 feet long. Smaller, faster, and much lighter than other seagoing warships, destroyers had ride their way through the rough seas. With limited resources, the crew had to overcome challenges as a team and make do with what they had.</p><p>Because of the thin armor of their ships, the rugged conditions, and the reputation of a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude, destroyer men took pride in their nickname: &quot;Tin can sailors.&quot;</p>",

Here in the wardroom, you stand at the center of the commissioned officers&apos; living space. Serving as the living room, dining room, conference room, courtroom, and formal ceremonial hall, it was the the most open and comfortable space on the ship. Nevertheless, enlisted seamen could serve on this ship for a year and never see this room.</p><p>As a privilege of rank, the officers had stewards assigned to the wardroom to prepare and serve their meals out of the nearby pantry. The food, however, was paid for by the officers themselves. Just below this deck are the officers&apos; staterooms. Smaller than most college dormitories, officers still had to share the stateroom with one or two other officers.</p><p>Yet even tradition yields to the mission of a ship to serve the fleet and the nation. If you look above the wardroom table, a surgical lamp hangs overhead. In time of need, this room served as the primary casualty station and the ship&apos; operating room.

					introText : "<p>The quarterdeck is the front door of the ship. The gangway connects the ship to a pier or dock at the brow on the Port side of the ship. From here, crew members began or ended their cruise aboard <i>Cassin Young</i>. This is also where crew members had the opportunity to punctuate their voyage with trips to foreign ports while on Liberty. It is at the quarterdeck where they begin and end their adventures. In the 1950s, Crew members visited ports across the globe. For most of the men, it was an opportunity they could use to see the world. During World War II, however, crew members did not visit a port for almost 16 solid months. Because of the demands of war cruising, the only respite off the ship were occasional visits to &quot;Beer Islands.&quot; On Mog-Mog island in the Ulithi Atoll, crew members enjoyed but a few hours at a time on solid land. There, they could have drinks, grilled food, play games, and go for a swim</p><p>As the front door of the ship, the Quarterdeck also played an important role for ceremonial occasions. Commissioning ceremonies, inspections, and award ceremonies brought dignitaries aboard. Expected to show respect to visiting Admirals and dignitaries, the crew would appear at attention in clean dress whites while standing on perfectly swept and clean decks during such occasions. Everything was to be done with perfect precision. If not, the crew quickly found out that they &quot;better get it right the next time.&quot;</p>",

When was the parrot going to talk? </span><span class=transcription data-start=115.8 data-end=127.3>They were in fact, as I recall, placing bets on it and things. You had nothing to do at sea and you figure you&apos;d have pools when the parrot, what day the parrot would talk, what hour the parrot would talk. </span><span class=transcription data-start=127.5 data-end=139.5>Well as we were underway there came a time whenever the occasion arose for planes, a tow plane, a sleve plane, to be able to be in the area. </span><span class=transcription data-start=139.6 data-end=144.8>They always sent it out to give us anti-aircraft practice. </span><span class=transcription data-start=144.9 data-end=148.2>I remember the one time, the first time the parrot was aboard. </span><span class=transcription data-start=148.3 data-end=157.9>The screening plane came along, of course the plane streamed its sleeve. And there is nothing worse, more violent than the clap of a 5 inch gun. </span><span class=transcription data-start=157.9 data-end=162.8>It just, it rocks you, unless you got used to it. I never got used to it. </span><span class=transcription data-start=162.9 data-end=168.3>It&apos;s a tremendous clap. It just hurts, it hurts your ears to hear it. </span><span class=transcription data-start=168.4 data-end=173.0>Of course the parrot had never heard anything on the island it had been on. </span><span class=transcription data-start=173.1 data-end=186.3>It&apos;s sitting there on the Chief&apos;s shoulder. Of course in these sleeve exercises the crew, the deck crew, used to just sit around and razz the Gunnery force. </span><span class=transcription data-start=186.4 data-end=195.0>Because it was all 5 inch mounts. Sure enough the sleeve came up the side and he&apos;s waiting. </span><span class=transcription data-start=195.1 data-end=201.2>And word came over the speaker, &quot;Stand By, coming on the range, coming on the range, commence firing&quot; </span><span class=transcription data-start=201.3 data-end=207.7>Of course then we waited for the first clap. That was always the worst one because after they started firing you became used to it. </span><span class=transcription data-start=207.7 data-end=213.4>Of course the parrot is sitting there blinking lazily on the Chief&apos;s shoulder when the first 5 inch went off. </span><span class=transcription data-start=213.5 data-end=221.1>And the whole ship jumped and the parrot of course wasn&apos;t even about to stay close to anything like that. </span><span class=transcription data-start=221.2 data-end=225.5>Never heard it before. Off he went flying over the ocean, like mad. </span><span class=transcription data-start=225.6 data-end=236.9>Not only was he flying like mad directly away from the ship into nowhere, but while he was flying he was screaming. Ywaking away as he went flying from the ship. </span><span class=transcription data-start=237.0 data-end=250.7>Of course the Chief is just completely upset and he&apos;s just screaming at the parrot to come back, ya know, and behind him this big Bozen mate, this big brute is just beating him on the back saying &quot;ayyy it&apos;s talking, it&apos;s talking, it&apos;s talking!&quot; </span></span><span class=transcription data-start=250.7 data-end=259.8>So the last we saw of the parrot as it grew dimmer and dimmer on the horizon but you could still hear it screaming away and the fella was just delighted because the parrot had finally talked. </span><span class=transcription data-start=261.4 data-end=267.1>The other mascot we had was longer term and we called him bogey. </span><span class=transcription data-start=267.2 data-end=273.4>And he was a little white terrier. I have a picture of him here that I&apos;ll get to you. </span><span class=transcription data-start=274.5 data-end=283.4>As I recall we picked him after we were down being repaired and got the fox&apos;s mast on down there. </span><span class=transcription data-start=283.5 data-end=288.9>We spent some time being repaired it was a period of a couple of weeks if more. </span><span class=transcription data-start=290.0 data-end=296.2>Of course all during that time the idea is relax the crew and send them to shore and just give it as good of a time as you could. </span><span class=transcription data-start=297.9 data-end=304.4>During that time the picked up Bogey. Bogey was a little white terrier, God knows where he came from.God knows what pedigree he was. </span><span class=transcription data-start=304.5 data-end=309.1>But he was about 4-5 inches tall and really a cute little dog. </span><span class=transcription data-start=310.1 data-end=315.7>And bogey became a real pal of everyone aboard the ship. They&apos;s be just delighted with him. </span><span class=transcription data-start=315.9 data-end=323.6>But Bogey had a problem, because his feet were so small, his legs were so short that he couldn&apos;t climb any of the steel ladders. </span><span class=transcription data-start=323.7 data-end=329.5>So unless someone carried him up and down he was always on the main deck. </span><span class=transcription data-start=330.4 data-end=337.8>They had a place for him to sleep there and everything else because while we were down there being repaid of course it was very quiet and everything else. </span><span class=transcription data-start=337.9 data-end=345.5>So Bogey was living the life when we finally went back up to the Buckner Bay Incident. </span><span class=transcription data-start=346.0 data-end=357.5>When we opened fire the night of the Buckner Bay Incident, that was the first time we had opened fire when Bogey was aboard. </span><span class=transcription data-start=357.6 data-end=362.5>A somewhat similar thing happened to Bogey that happened to the parrot. </span><span class=transcription data-start=362.6 data-end=368.5>After we got through with the damage and everything. </span><span class=transcription data-start=368.6 data-end=376.2>We were just cleaning up, I remember everyone was concerned where was Bogey, because they couldn&apos;t find him. Everybody was running all over the main deck where he had been. </span><span class=transcription data-start=376.3 data-end=381.6>And they were looking down. They were trying to figure out if he had been carried down into the fire room or whatever. </span><span class=transcription data-start=381.7 data-end=386.8>And they couldn&apos;t find Bogey and he finally ended up, they found him up in the Captain&apos;s bridge. </span><span class=transcription data-start=386.9 data-end=397.0>Way up on the main deck where the captain was, huddled down back aft there by the signal bags. </span><span class=transcription data-start=397.1 data-end=403.0>Which means, I thought it was three ladders he would have had to climb, but I see now today that it was just two ladders. </span><span class=transcription data-start=403.1 data-end=407.5>But they were long ladders. And that was the most remarkable thing after we had sort of relaxed. </span><span class=transcription data-start=407.9 data-end=416.8>After that tragedy at Buckner Bay was the question went around of how in the world Bogey ever made those two ladders. </span><span class=transcription data-start=416.9 data-end=421.7>But I got a feeling that once those guns started to go off, Bogey figured boy he just had to get out of there. </span><span class=transcription data-start=421.8 data-end=428.3>And they only way he could see to go was up. He made the ladders. He made it all the way as high as he could go but there was just no place else to go.</span>"

In the two fire rooms,  Watertenders (later, Boiler Tenders) controlled the burning of fuel oil to generate steam in the boilers. Each room supplied steam to a corresponding engine room.

Other auxiliary equipment, from pumps to electrical generators, were also driven by the steam. All of this equipment was absolutely vital to keep the ship operational.</p>",

The threat of submarines meant that entire ships could be sunk with one well placed hit by a surprise enemy torpedo. One primary role of a destroyer was to hunt and kill a submarine before it claimed ships in a fleet and the lives on board. Once a ship detected a submarine, torpedomen readied depth charges set to explode close to the enemy&apos; depth underwater. Once the ship passed over the suspected location, torpedomen fired an array of charges in patterns designed to maximize the chances of a successful hit. Unless debris floated up from a destroyed submarine, though, it was often impossible to confirm a kill of a submarine.</p><p>During World War II, <i>Cassin Young</i> hunted three suspected underwater contacts, but never confirmed if they successfully destroyed an enemy submarine. In the Cold War, the threats of submarines only grew greater. Though it was peacetime, <i>Cassin Young</i>&apos;s encounters with suspected submarines during the 1950&apos;s proved just as fraught with tension and gut-wrenching uncertainty as it proved during wartime.</p>",

					introText : "<p>Though versatile and powerful, the 5 inch guns aboard <i>Cassin Young</i> had its shortcomings. Against large armored ships, the 5 inch shells had a remote chance of penetrating the hull of a battleship. Against squadrons of swarming aircraft, the 5 inch guns alone could not provide the sheer amount of rapid firepower needed to throw up walls of shrapnel into the sky. Secondary weapons aboard destroyers like <i>Cassin Young</i> aimed to make ships the most effective against the threats they may encounter, but each added system came at the cost of space, weight, and demand upon the crew.</p><p>As the naval battlefield changed, the types and layouts of secondary weaponry changed aboard ship. The 20mm anti-aircraft guns, for example, were largely obsolete by the close of the Second World War. <i>Cassin Young</i> originally had seven, but by the 1950&apos;s she had none. Today, only one 20 mm gun remains on the fantail of the ship as an example. Even the 40mm gun placement went from five separate &quot;twin&quot; mounts to two &quot;quad&quot; mounts and one &quot;twin&quot; mounts after the end of World War II. By the time of her last cruise in the late 1950&apos;s, the 40 mm guns were removed entirely because they were no longer effective against faster jet aircraft. These 40 mm mounts have since been reinstalled.</p><p>To enhance capabilites against ships, <i>Fletcher</i> class destroyers like <i>Cassin Young</i> originally carried two 5-torpedo mounts during World War II. Increasingly, torpedoes on destroyers were seen as a &quot;last resort&quot; when destroyers found themselves outgunned and outnumbered. <i>Cassin Young</i> was fortunate to never need to fire her torpedoes in a desperate battle against enemy cruisers or battleships. Reflective of the need to match the capabilities of the ship with the enemies she was likely to encounter, half of <i>Cassin Young</i>&apos;s torpedoes on board were removed to make room for the more important &quot;quad&quot; 40mm anti-aircraft guns.</p>",

At Okinawa&mdash;the final battle of the Pacific Theater&mdash;Destroyermen had to make a dangerous last stand against deadly Kamikaze attacks. On picket duty surrounding the island, the destroyers were a prime target for the suicide plane attacks.</p><p>On the 12th of April, 1945, a plane just missed the <i>Cassin Young</i>, striking her mast and exploding just off the ship. Many were wounded, and one man was killed in the action. After repairs, the crew returned to the same raging battle of Okinawa. At around 2 a.m. on the 30th of July, 1945, radar contact picked up a lone aircraft. Men scrambled to general quarters and opened fire in the dark as some confusion ensued over possible friendly aircraft in the area. Then a lone biplane swept over, turned, and struck the middle of <i>Cassin Young</i> on the starboard side. The explosion destroyed the whaleboat and ripped through the surrounding bulkheads and decks. Fires began all around the area. All told, twenty men lost their life, one was missing, and 47 men were wounded. Nonetheless, the determined crew put out the fires and restored power within an hour, and the ship survived the attack.",
